# Our Manifesto \(or WTF!?\)

### Sudden Thought

{% hint style="info" %}
I have identified my basic needs, passions, and hopefully soon will be able to express my big idea in the literal and clear language.
{% endhint %}

> **Social majority** over the centuries has grown around the idea of confidence in their lives Priority \#0 - _**a destiny to lead the campaign finding out a sense of the Human Being**_. Well... that's exactly where the problem's roots are coming along into this reality. And the reason is always the same - always first, is that everyone has to accomplish a quest finding out and realizing own needs & passions, so next they could set their life goals, priorities, and objectives \(that's exactly next-level quest as you already guess\). And only those, who will win in all this three rounds \(realizing they need to set objectives... acquiring the life passion... achieving all their goals..\) may try leading the rest to the initial idea. But the main fun is there are no stupid people left afterwards, who is willing to even ask such a kind of questions, thanking God they survived those three critical battles with the only unbeatable enemy - themselves
